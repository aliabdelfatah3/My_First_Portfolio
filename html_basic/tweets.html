          <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
          <p>
            Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of
            websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing,
            web programming, and database management. Web development is a
            crucial skill in the digital age, as it enables businesses and
            individuals to create and maintain their online presence
            effectively.

          <h2>Front-End vs. Back-End Development</h2>
          <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
          <p>
            Front-end development, also known as client-side development,
            involves creating the part of a website that users interact with.
            This includes everything that users see and experience on the web
            page, such as layout, design, and interactive elements. Technologies
            commonly used in front-end development include HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript.
          </p>

          <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
          <p>
            Back-end development, or server-side development, focuses on the
            server, databases, and application logic. It is responsible for
            managing the data and ensuring that everything on the client-side
            works properly. Common languages and technologies used in back-end
            development include PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js.
          </p>

            businesses and individuals alike. A well-developed website can help
            attract and retain customers, provide valuable information, and
