        <h1>Introduction to Web Development</h1>

        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
          Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of
          websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web
          programming, and database management. Web development is a crucial
          skill in the digital age, as it enables businesses and individuals to
          create and maintain their online presence effectively.

        <h2>Front-End vs. Back-End Development</h2>
        <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
        <p>
          Front-end development, also known as client-side development, involves
          creating the part of a website that users interact with. This includes
          everything that users see and experience on the web page, such as
          layout, design, and interactive elements. Technologies commonly used
          in front-end development include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
        <p>
          Back-end development, or server-side development, focuses on the
          server, databases, and application logic. It is responsible for
          managing the data and ensuring that everything on the client-side
          works properly. Common languages and technologies used in back-end
          development include PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js.
        </p>

          businesses and individuals alike. A well-developed website can help
          attract and retain customers, provide valuable information, and
